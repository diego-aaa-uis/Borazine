# Borazine

Borazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (BH)3(NH)3. In this cyclic compound, the three BH units and three NH units alternate. The compound is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene. Like benzene, borazine is a colourless liquid. For this reason borazine is sometimes referred to as "inorganic benzene". 
Our proposal together with Dr. Jhon Fredy Perez is the investigation of the movement of the pi electrons in the molecule when light strikes, as well as the reactivity when putting substituents in the molecule. We hope to contribute to collaborative science, to free science.
